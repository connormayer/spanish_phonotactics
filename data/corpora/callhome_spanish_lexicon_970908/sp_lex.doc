1.  Summary abstract

The LDC Spanish lexicon was compiled primarily for support of the
project on Large Vocabulary Conversational Speech Recognition (LVCSR),
sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense.

The LDC Spanish lexicon consists of 45,582 word, and contains separate
information fields with morphological, phonological, stress, and
frequency information for each word.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.  Token coverage

The token coverage by the LDC Spanish lexicon of words occurring in
the 20 LDC Spanish Callhome devtest transcripts (10 minutes of
conversation each) is 98.7%.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

3.  Lexicon information fields

The LDC Spanish lexicon contains nine tab-separated information
fields:

Field 1:    orthographic form (headword)
Field 2:    morphological analysis of the headword
Field 3:    pronunciation of the headword
Field 4:    primary stress information of the word
Field 5:    frequency of the word in the 80 Callhome Spanish training 
	      transcripts
Field 6:    frequency of the word in Corpus Oral radio transcripts
Field 7:    frequency of the word in AP newswire
Field 8:    frequency of the word in Reuters newswire
Field 9:    frequency of the word in El Norte newswire

More on each of these fields is described the sections below.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

4.  Orthographic conventions

The orthographic representation has canonical capitalization,
i.e. proper names and such are capitalized.

//  used to separate alternate analyses

Except for the class of exceptions noted below, pronunciations given 
in field three of the lexicon have been generated automatically from
the orthography using the following software and accompanying file, 
which are available from the LDC:

	spron.pl
	basic_rules

The class of exceptions, 313 words in the lexicon, have been hand-
corrected for pronunciation and tagged as "For" in the morphological
field.  This class includes not only foreign words, but single
orthographic characters with no stressable vowel; some interjections,
hesitation sounds, and acronyms; and words that have alternate
pronunciations separated by //.  All of these hand-corrected
pronunciations are listed in the accompanying file:

	preferences

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

7.  Stress information

The fourth field in the lexicon contains information about primary
word stress.  Each syllable of the word is indicated by a number, with
unstressed syllables indicated by "0" and the stressed syllable
indicated by "1".  Only one stressed syllable per word is indicated.

Alternate pronunciations separated by // also have corresponding
alternate stress separated by //.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

8.  Frequency counts and corpora

The frequency counts shown in fields 5-9 of the lexicon are raw,
i.e. not normalized in any way; they are for orthographic forms
regardless of capitalization.  We have used only alphabetic words from
the corpora, i.e. excluding punctuation and such.

A brief description of the corpora from which frequency counts were
taken is as follows.

Field 5:	80 transcripts:  143,394 words from the 80 LDC Spanish 
		Callhome telephone speech corpus transcripts

Field 6: 	Corpus Oral:   941,199 words of Madrid Radio transcripts

Field 7:  	AP newswire:  8,429,549  words of Associated Press 
		newswire text, assembled from their Spanish language 
		services in Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, and Puerto Rico

Field 8:  	Reuters:  18,742,153 words of Reuters newswire text,
		from Reuters Latin American Business Report, created in
		Brazil, and Reuters Spanish Language Business Report,
